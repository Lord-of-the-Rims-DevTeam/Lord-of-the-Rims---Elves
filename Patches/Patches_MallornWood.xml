  <!-- adding Mallorn Wood as an alternative for wood when used as building material is not possible for everything right now.
        Some buildings and weapons like torch, campfire, bows... are made only of wood and we could change that to use "Woody" stuff, but this changes the structure of vanilla code and I'm not comfortable with this. This isn't the main issue though.
        Some other buildings already have a stuffCost (e.g. main component of Butcher Table, which always requires some wood), so there's no way of letting the player choose which wood to use. Rimworld doesn't allow for multiple stuffCosts as there is only the one dropdown to choose it.
        The best solution for this may be to add a recipe to a crafting table to convert mallorn wood into vanilla wood (as done in other mods e.g. for bamboo). Unless we want to duplicate every vanilla building that uses wood, e.g. make a "Mallornwood Butcher Table" and a "Mallornwood Water Mill" etc.
